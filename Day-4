We have known why we should choose AWS and what factors we need to consider when choosing a region for our customers and/or applications. But, how everything is happening in AWS? There are numerous services and resources that we do use within AWS but how is all this working underneath?

The answer is "𝙀𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙬𝙚 𝙙𝙤 𝙞𝙣 𝘼𝙒𝙎 𝙞𝙨 𝙖𝙣 𝘼𝙋𝙄 𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙨 𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙙". 

That means, if we're using any resource or configuring EC2 instances or trying to use any AWS service, everything is an API call. Whether we choose any server or change the storage system that's all happening because of an API call. And, we can make API calls in three ways -

𝟭. 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗲 : It's a web-based Console to access cloud resources & the below image shows we can access any AWS service available to us. https://lnkd.in/g4Z-fRN3

𝟮. 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 (𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗖𝗟𝗜) : It's a unified tool to manage AWS services. Suppose we want to run a report to collect data from multiple servers so we can do so programmatically by scheduling an AWS CLI script with an API call to run a report and fetch data. https://lnkd.in/gCWCrRhp

Example of listing all buckets in S3 using below command -
𝙖𝙬𝙨 𝙨3 𝙖𝙥𝙞 𝙡𝙞𝙨𝙩-𝙗𝙪𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙩𝙨 

𝟯. 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗞𝗶𝘁𝘀 (𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗦𝗗𝗞𝘀) : Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application source code with AWS services. These are open-source and maintained by AWS for most programming languages like C++, Go, Python, Java, Javascript etc. If we have an application that runs in Python then we can use AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). https://lnkd.in/gcmYrxBR

Below is the code snapshot to connect to AWS EC2 resource through boto.

𝘦𝘤2 = 𝘣𝘰𝘵𝘰3.𝘤𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵('𝘦𝘤2')
𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦 = 𝘦𝘤2.𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘣𝘦_𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘴()
𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘵(𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘦)
